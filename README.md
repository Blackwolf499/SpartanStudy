# SpartanStudy
SpartanStudy is a small tool designed to track your global ranking for TryHackMe.com. 
It updates and logs your global positional ranking every 60 seconds by accessing an API that
TryHackMe hadn't secured properly. It monitors daily increase of rank, as-well as displaying
your change in global rank expressed as a percentage, so you can see how many people you've surpassed
in a days work.

Initially the SpartanStudy tool fetched data through web-scraping
but after discovering numerous APIs were accessible I had then decided to take advantage of that.

It also doubles as a study tool in which it implements the Pomodoro study technique, 
The pomodoro study technique is a neuroscientifically proven method to efficently study.
Your work should be broken down into 20 minute segments, followed by a 3-5 minute break.
